        <p>I have been fiddling around with <a href="https://wordpress.org/" title="Wordpress CMS">Wordpress</a> as <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> for some sites, including this one. Working with Wordpress themes and templates is a tedious task, and I haven’t gotten completely into it. It’s a little bit too easy to just install plugins that do some magic, but not necessarily exactly the way you want it.</p>
