I was reminded the other day that I needed to get a 404 page done. So far, I have just been letting Github Pages do its job and present a *Page not found* page whenever a visitor type in a faulty URL, or in any other way end up on a papge that doesn't exist on this site.

[An article on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/the-101-course-on-crafting-404-pages/) by [Shelby Rogers](https://twitter.com/solodev) got me going, and I immediately set up a basic page with GA tracking and all.

There is [a guide on Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site/) on how to set up a 404 page, and all in all it was done within a few minutes. Next step will be to add something creative to the page, but for now at least I have something else than the default page.
