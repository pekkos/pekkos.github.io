A while ago I wrote about [adding HTTPS to Github Pages using Cloudflare](https://www.pekkos.com/blog/migrating-to-https/). And it was a long overdue task of mine thatâ€™s been on my todo list for quite some time.

Anyway, turns out my research was a little behind in time, since by May 1, Github [actually offers HTTPS for custom domains](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/). I will look into that in the near future.
