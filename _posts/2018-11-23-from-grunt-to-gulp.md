As a long time user of the task runner [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com), I was finally pushed to make a switch to [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com). It happened at my new employer [Fiwe](https://www.fiwe.com/se/) where they favor Gulp and Webpack over Grunt.

So I decided to move from Grunt to Gulp on this blog too. Not that I had to, but because it seemed as a natural change since I was optimizing front-end tasks anyway.

It seems that Gulp is a weeny bit faster than Grunt too, so the change will probably be the better choice in the long run. At first I was somewhat confused by Gulp's more programming-like syntax being used to the configuration-like syntax of Grunt, but it didn't atke long to get used to.

So I guess I'm with the cool kids now.
