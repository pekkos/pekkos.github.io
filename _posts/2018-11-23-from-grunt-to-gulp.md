As a long time user of the [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) task runner, I was finally pushed to make the switch to [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com). It happened at my new employer [Fiwe](https://www.fiwe.com/se/) where they favor Gulp and Webpack over Grunt.

So I decided to move from Grunt to Gulp on this blog too. Not that I had to, but because it seemed as a natural change since I was optimizing front-end tasks anyway.

At a first glance Gulp seems to be a weeny bit faster than Grunt too, so the change will probably be the better choice in the long run. I must admit I was somewhat confused by Gulp's more programming-like syntax being used to the configuration-like syntax of Grunt, but it didn't take long to get used to the new way of writing tasks.

I even liked it better, actually.
