I have been fiddling around with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress CMS") as <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> for some sites, including this one. Working with Wordpress themes and templates is a tedious task, and I haven't gotten completely into it. It's a little bit too easy to just install plugins that do some magic, but not necessarily exactly the way you want it.

I guess I just want to be in control. In control of the javascripts running on the site, in control of the markup and css included. In control of where in the file structure my asset files are stored. In a Wordpress installation I find it a little hard to be in control of all those things.

Also, I have always had the ambition to make a really good looking website before I publish anything. In the end, I've installed some sort of basic site with some rudimentary Wordpress theme, and instead of blogging I've had the intention to start designing the page with lots of eye-candy and fancy Wordpress stuff.

However, working full-time as web designer leaves me with limited time and energy to keep doing the same kind of work stuff in my spare time.

And so, nothing ever really got published. No posts, no nothing.

Time for a change. I decided to throw out the Wordpress installation on this domain, and instead try a different route. The last few years static HTML generators have become increasingly popular, so this blog is now built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll static website and blog builder"). This gives me the opportunity to be in control, and set up a folder structure exactly as I want it.

At the moment, the site looks like crap, intentionally. I really wanted to just start blogging to set the pace. It will look better and better along the way, rest assured.

Ok, I'm ready to plunge in, and dive head first into learning, blogging and spreading the word of stuff I find interesting within the wonderful world of [Web Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design).

This will be fun, at least for me. Cheers!
